# How to Make a Pull Request With GitHub Desktop

On GitHub, you can make to another person's repository and suggest that they accept your changes. This is called making a pull request. The easiest way to do this is using an app called GitHub Desktop. 

1. [Make a GitHub account.](https://github.com/) 
2. [Install GitHub Desktop.](https://desktop.github.com)
3. **Forking the repository:** Go to the repository you want to contribute to (for example, <https://github.com/walnutprogramming/Directions>). Click on "*Fork*" in the top right. 
4. **Cloning your forked repository:** In your fork, click on the green "*Clone or download*" button and click on "*Open in Desktop*". 
5. **Creating a new branch for your changes:** In GitHub Desktop, click on "*Branch*", then type in a name for your new **branch**. For example, if you're fixing a typo, you might name the branch "`typo-fix`". 
6. **Making the changes:** Open a text editor and make the changes you want to make to the repository. (If you're not sure what you can do to help, you can look in the "*Issues*" tab on GitHub to see what problems need to be fixed.)
7. **Committing your changes:** Now you can make a **commit** on the repository on your computer. In GitHub Desktop, you should see the files that you changed checked in the left sidebar. In the bottom of the left sidebar, type in a summary and description of the changes you made. 
8. **(Optional) Make more changes:** If there's more stuff you want to change before you submit your pull request, you can still change more files and commit again (steps 6-7).
9. **Pushing your changes back to your fork:** In GitHub Desktop, click on "Push origin" in the top bar. 
10. **Creating a pull request:** Go to your fork in GitHub, and click "New pull request". Type in a description of the changes you made so that others can decide whether to accept your changes. 
11. **Wait for others to comment on your pull request.** If you want to make changes to your pull request, there are instructions on how to do that on the page for the pull request.
